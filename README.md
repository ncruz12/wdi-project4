# CSS MAGIC

## Description
CSS Magic is a an application where the user can learn more about the wonders of CSS(Cascading Style Sheets). Many people seem to dislike CSS and since I enjoy the design and visual concept of it, I decided to focus this project on demostrating several things CSS can achieve. If others would like to replicate a similar effect all they would have to do is use CSS Magic as a refernce to explore the many different capabilities of CSS.
